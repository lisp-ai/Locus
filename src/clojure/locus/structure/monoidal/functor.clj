; A presheaf of monoids is a functor F: C -> Mon. It is a generalisation of a presheaf of abelian
; groups. Additionally, when we later consider presheaves of commutative unital rings it is useful
; to consider the underlying additive presheaves of abelian groups and multiplicative
; presheaves of monoids both of which are part of the presheaf of monoids theory. We also note
; that presheaves of monoids are always special types of category-valued functors.
