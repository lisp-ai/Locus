; Let C be a category, then C^(->) is its arrow category. This category has special morphisms that define it
; which are provided separately in the morphism file. These morphisms are defined by the MorphismOfMorphisms
; class. Arrow categories are uniquely associated with special subcategories called comma categories for each
; object which are the under and over categories respectively. So as special cases, in order to construct
; the under and over categories we have input action and output action classes.

; Arrow categories play a fundamental role in topos theory by their relationship with the elementary topos
; Sets^(->). In addition, topoi are distinguished by the fact that their over categories are again topoi.
; As a consequence, we play special attention here to the construction of under and over categories
; from a category and one of its objects.
