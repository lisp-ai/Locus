; A morphism in the topos of quivers is a natural transformation of the underlying
; copresheaves of the two quivers. It follows that there are Sets^(->) valued functors
; that define commutative diagrams over the source and target functions of the quiver,
; with respect to any morphism in the topos of quivers. Furthermore, there is a subobject
; classifier of Quivers, which we implement in this file.
