; Objects in the topos Sets^[1, {1,1} 1]
; A diamond is so called because when depicted its defining commutative diagram appears
; as a diamond. In other words, it is a copresheaf over the four element diamond shaped
; partial order. In this file, all relevant operations for objects of this topos
; like products and coproducts are defined and implemented.

; Objects in this topos have an additional characteristic, which is that they emerge from
; the morphisms in the topos of functions Sets^(->). Consequently, every diamond is
; defined so that has a source function and a target function. The subobject classifier
; and characteristic morphisms in the topos Sets^(->) are defined in this file and an
; ontology of diamonds is provided.

; Every morphism in a topos has an associated epi-mono factorisation. In the case of
; diamonds, which are like morphisms of functions, they have a function congruence
; for an epi part and a function subobject for a mono part. This corresponds to the
; partition kernel and set image of a function, which now occurs in pairs as every
; morphism of functions is defined over a pair of functions.

; The protocol of concrete higher morphism is used for structured diamonds
(defprotocol ConcreteHigherMorphism
  "Topos theoretic foundations often lead us to treat functions as objects in their own
  right. Further, we often have categories that are often a lot like categorise with additional
  structure. Corresponding to this, we generalize from categories of structured sets to categories
  of structured functions and we generalize from underlying functions to underlying morphisms
  of functions in the arrow topos of the topos of Sets."
