; Morphisms in a topos of copresheaves
; Let C be a category and Sets^C its topos of copresheaves. Then a morphism of copresheaves is a
; morphism in the topos Sets^C. By a simple construction, we can also treat this as a copresheaf
; object of a topos in its own right by using the topos Sets^{T_2 x C}. We will use this
; in order to create the presheaf theoretic logic of morphisms of presheaves. This is an important
; part of making presheaf topos theory a holistic system, in which it is possible not only
; to reason about presheaves but morphisms of them as well. With this, presheaf topos theory
; is a complete system of reasoning.
