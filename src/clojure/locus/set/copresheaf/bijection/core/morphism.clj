; Objects in the topos Sets^[2,2]
; A gem is an object of the topos Sets^[2,2] and therefore it is a type of copresheaf.
; The data of a gem is specified by a pair of two different diamonds: one for the
; forwards function and one for the target function for a pair of bijections. So
; a gem is an extension of the concept of a diamond, hence their name. This file
; implements products, coproducts, subobjects, and quotients in the topos of gems.
