; Morphisms in the category of semirings
; This class provides support for morphisms in the category of semirings. The
; category of semirings is characterized by a number of forgetful functors
; to various other categories, such as the category of semigroups. In particular,
; semiring morphisms induce morphisms of additive and multiplicative semigroups.
