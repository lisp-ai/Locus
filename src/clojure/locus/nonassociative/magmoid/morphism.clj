; A magmoid functor is a homomorphism in the category of magmoids. Magmoids in turn are
; defined as the horizontal categorification of the concept of a magma, so they are
; nonassociative generalisations of categories or magmas with multiple objects.
; As is the case for categories, homomorphisms of magmoids can be defined by morphism
; of their underlying quivers subject to some extra conditions. So the functor from the
; category of magmoids to the category of quivers is faithful.
