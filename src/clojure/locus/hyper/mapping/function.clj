; Hyperfunctions:
; The category Rel of sets and relations does not form an elementary topos. As a consequence,
; it lacks many of the desirable features of a topos. In order to get around this, we represent
; Rel as a concrete subcategory of Sets consisting of image functions, where an image
; function is a complete union homomorphism of power sets. The category Rel can then be
; embedded in the topos Sets, with reference to this special class of functions.

; In our implementation of multivalued relations, you can convert a multivalued function into an
; image function by using the to-function method. In the other direction, we provide the
; singleton-images-relation function to convert a member of the image functions class
; into a multivalued function. This lets us transfer back and forth between the category Rel
; and the topos Sets.

; While a multivalued function in Rel is primarily related to an image function of power
; sets, another classes of functions corresponds to hyperfunctions: the set valued
; functions produced by singleton images. This correspondence states that a multivalued
; function from A to B is like a function from A to the power set of B. As a consequence,
; hyperfunctions implement the clojure.lang.IFn interface in such a manner that
; the application of an element a is the set of elements b that form ordered pairs
; in the multivalued function.

; Multivalued functions are important in the topos theoretic foundations of computing
; as a means of defining an abstraction layer over the topoi of sets and functions.
; Therefore, the terminology that we use in much of this file is determined by the
; needs of topos theory. In particular, we use make the definition of the hyperfunction
; image and inverse image correspond to the definitions of partition images and
; inverse images used in the topos theoretic models of dataflow. The converse image
; is then defined separately from the relational inverse image.

; These concepts allow us to define a subalgebra lattice of a hyperfunction, which
; is the lattice that is mapped into the lattice of congruences of a function.
; This subalgebra lattice is basically implemented in the lattice folder. It restores
; the subobject lattice of a function in the special case in which a function is
; expressed as a hyperfunction.
